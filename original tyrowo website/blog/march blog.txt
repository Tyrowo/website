I'm not sure what part of the brain does this,
but it's utterly fascinating when one hyperfixation tears the hold of your previous one.

I've been stuck on magic for two or three years again. Was watching week to week. Completing daily challenges online. Trying to maintain a full collection.
CONSTANTLY watching twitch streams.
Now when I hop in the shower instead of going to twitch I go to youtube and try to watch a coding lesson.
It feels good. Like it's the first time I've been motivated for something productive in decades.

Spooky though, every time I feel my attention slipping and wanting to binge some anime I second guess myself, whether I'm really fascinated.
But I really do need a mental relaxation minute Once in a while.
From an inside perspective it's hard to gauge how much I'm chugging. I've been cautioned against burning out too hard too fast, and it's pretty spooky.
The burnout is definitely something I've experienced before.
I just can't afford to, here.
