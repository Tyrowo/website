                <br>
                October Update!<br> <br>
            </h3>

            <p>
                It's been a quite a bit since I started this coding journey. Almost 8 full months now. <br>
                Back end systems have dominated much of my interest, and so I haven't had any reason to update this
                page,
                but I'm glad for my experience in front end development working on my latest project. <br> I was quickly
                able
                to apply what I learned to
                create an options interface page for my google chrome extension. Like riding a bike, I suppose.
                <br><br>
                Enumerating all the things I've learned over the past 8 months would be excessive. Reading through my
                first post
                definitely felt like overkill lol. But to summarize my accomplishments,
                I'm constantly learning more about algorithms, data structures, and Javascript as a language. <br>
                <br>
                I took a month to develop and test a Google Chrome extension for my personal use, [My] Procrastination
                Buster. <br>
                Although I was fairly successful in implementing my vision,
                a great deal of the functionality went totally against the Chrome's Manifest V3 design space of service
                workers for extensions...
                although it's in the Chrome Web Store now, I've had to abandon the project as it is. <br>
                <br>
                What an incredible learning experience though! <br>
                Creating something and putting it into motion really cemented the once-abstract concepts of
                object oriented programming to me. Every hurdle was a great chance to learn new methods and applications
                for functions, and
                I think it's really beautiful to see functions like setTimeouts react to user input in ways that you
                don't really see when working on solely on algorithms.
                It was a great place to solidify my working knowledge of building classes,
                implement good practices like creating smaller helper functions to keep my code dry and more legible,
                and experiment with building recursive function calls. <br>
                I kept a nice github repository of my progress, so it was nice practice getting used to a repository
                system too, despite being the only contributor to the project.
                <br><br>
                I've been pretty intimidated by the thought of dedicating time to projects, not knowing where to start.
                <br>
                Until recently I was convinced that all my projects need to be big and impressive works,
                something that I can talk about at length. But I'm excited to work on something smaller next.
                <br><br>
                I've had some minor accomplishments, too. I've worked on expanding my coding literacy by taking
                Codecademy courses in C#, React, and SQL. <br>
                Now that I've gotten some experience working with a "stricter" language than JS and Python it's
                definitely not as difficult as I'd imagined.
                Though I still hate the idea of explicitly declaring the size of arrays. <br>
                And I've taken an approach to algorithms practice like a morning exercise routine - don't do too much
                and burn out, just get some reps in a different area every day.
                <br> <br>
                I'm so thankful to my family and friends that have made everything possible for me. I love you so much.
                <br>
                To my friends who took care of me when my ankle was recently severely injured and I was immobile for
                over a month,<br>
                to my friends and family who have given me a place to stay while I study and practice,<br>
                and to all my friends who I haven't yet stayed with but always promise that I can whenever I need/want
                to: <br>
                I owe you everything. ❥ <br>

            <h3>
                <br>
                My First Blog Entry<br> <br>
            </h3>

            <p>

                It’s kind of amazing how quickly things can change. <br> <br>
                This time last month I think I was just barely figuring out how to upload an html sheet to cPanel to
                test out how the hosting system worked. My original goal was to get a website up by my birthday.
                Technically I accomplished that, but it wasn’t really in a spot where I was comfortable showing anybody
                anything I had yet. All it was was my handwriting font thrown onto a webpage lol. So my new goal was to
                get something presentable by the end of the month. <br> <br>
                Since then what have I gotten done since? <br> <br>
                Starting from rudimentary CSS, I’ve added Favicons, flexbox, converted myself from using hex colors to
                using hsla, I struggled Forever to get linear gradients to work right, switched my preferred units of
                measurement like 4 times, layered backgrounds, created this cute notebook paper styling for my text
                posts so that my writing would look like it does in my journal, implemented internal and external links,
                I created a nav bar... <br> <br>
                And I also did my first coding project! I started with an easy little script just so I could focus on
                learning how to implement some javascript into html. Ended up learning about node.js a little to figure
                out a workaround for this console.log issue, and then had to learn how to write text to html (which
                ended up not needing to use the node.js I learned, but so it goes). Styling it and getting it to do what
                I wanted took both more and less effort than I expected, and I still have improvements I want to make,
                but it turned out pretty nice for my first thing. <br> <br>
                I had to do some research to figure out why my sub directories weren’t appearing. I’ve learned about
                pseudoelements and animations. I’ve played with cubic beziers and I’ve watched a couple dozen css trick
                videos to pick up some things here and there, it’s all pretty exciting. <br> <br>
                But jeez, when you write it all out it still doesn’t read like That much work for the past two weeks.
                There’s still so much more that I want to accomplish here, and everything looks a little rudimentary to
                me still. I’m not even really convinced on this being the colorway for the site, but it is kind of nice
                for now. I’ve got some plans for animations I want to make, I want to improve the look of these little
                pull tabs for my table of contents look a lot nicer, but it’s a good proof of concept for now. Trying to
                get even a simple animation on the nav bar keeps breaking things though, pretty frustrating trying to
                figure out what I’m doing wrong. <br> <br>
                One facet of my project so far is that I really wanted to build all of these different pages based on
                one CSS sheet. Half of that was for the ease of not rewriting everything for every subdirectory, but the
                other half was to see how much I could maintain and implement without compromising any of the other
                sheets. Figured it would be some good practice for bigger projects where I have a lot more to take care
                of. But now moving forward I’m going to be creating separate sheets for everything so I can work on the
                repeatability of the skills I’ve developed. I’ve also been developing some personal organization with my
                commenting that needs a little bit of improvement. Baby steps. <br> <br>
                But really the next two weeks I think I’ve focused too much on CSS and I’m going to focus a little bit
                on developing some more backend skills. I’ve been shirking my javascript and algorithm practice quite a
                bit to meet this deadline for myself. I also need to practice making and updating github repositories,
                because I kind of keep my notation in personal notepad files right now. In any case it’s really nice to
                bounce back and forth between html+css and javascript though, it actually keeps everything fresh and
                interesting. But I do also want to go through an interesting course on <a href=’https://web.dev/learn/’>
                    web.dev </a>. Found it through <a href=’https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnUYZLuoy1rq1aVMwx4aTzw’>
                    Google Chrome’s Youtube channel, </a> and it seems really helpful for learning about SEO. <br> <br>
                So what’s the point of this blog, anyway? I suppose it’s to keep up with progress that I’m making on the
                state of the site. Keep track of my general progress and make note of some skills that I’m developing.
                Sounds pretty boring, so I suppose I’ll write about some more general topics once in a while, too. <br>
                <br>
                To be quite honest this is almost more of a test blog post. But mission accomplished, I think. <br> <br>
                Thanks for being here for it. <br> <br>

    Inspirations
      I'd like to thank my mother and father, my sister and brothers, my friends and my family,
      for always encouraging me to be myself, no matter how weird I've gotten over the years.
      I'd thank my grandma polly for teaching me checkers, and my darlin for teaching me poker.
      My dad first got me a gameboy with Kirby's Adventure In Dreamland, 
      and Super Smash Bros went on to be a huge part of my childhood, so huge thanks to Masahiro Sakurai.
      Although I had to take a break for about 12 years, I love Magic the Gathering and think Richard Garfield is a genius.
