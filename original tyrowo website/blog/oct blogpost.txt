feeling: positive

It's been a quite a bit since I started this coding journey. About 8 full months now. <br>
Back end systems have dominated much of my interests, and so I haven't had any reason to update this page,
but I'm glad for my experience in front end development working on this project. <br> I was quickly able to apply what I learned to
create an options interface page for my google chrome extension. Like riding a bike, I suppose.
<br><br>
Enumerating all the things I've learned over the past 8 months would be excessive. Reading my first post definitely felt like overkill lol. But to summarize my accomplishments, 
I'm constantly learning more about algorithms, data structures, and Javascript as a language. <br>
<br>
I took a month to develop and test a Google Chrome extension for my personal use, [My] Procrastination Buster. <br>
Although I was fairly successful in implementing my vision, 
a great deal of the functionality went totally against the Chrome's Manifest V3 design space of service workers for extensions, 
and although it's in the Chrome Web Store now, I've had to abandon the project as it is. <br>
What an incredible learning experience though! <br>
Creating something and putting it into motion really cemented the once-abstract concepts of
object oriented programming to me. Every hurdle was a great chance to learn new methods and applications for functions, and
I think it's really beautiful to see functions like setTimeouts react to user input in ways that you don't really see when working on solely on algorithms.
It was a great place to solidify my working knowledge of building classes, 
implement good practices like creating smaller helper functions to keep my code dry and more legible, 
and experiment with building recursive function calls. <br>
I kept a nice github repository of my progress, so it was nice practice getting used to a repository system too, despite being the only contributor.
<br><br>
I've been pretty intimidated by the thought of dedicating time to projects, not knowing where to start. <br>
Until recently I was convinced that all my projects need to be big and impressive works, 
something that I can talk about at length. But I'm excited to work on something smaller next. 
<br><br>
I've had some minor accomplishments, too. I've worked on expanding my coding literacy by taking Codecademy courses in C#, React, and SQL. <br>
Now that I've gotten some experience working with a "stricter" language than JS and Python it's definitely not as intimidating as I'd imagined.
Though I still hate the idea of explicitly declaring the size of arrays. <br>
And I've taken an approach to algorithms practice like a morning exercise routine - don't do too much and burn out, just get some reps in a different area every day.
<br> <br>
I'm so thankful to my family and friends that have made everything possible for me. I love you so much. <br>
To my friends who took care of me when my ankle was recently severely injured and I was immobile for over a month,<br>
to my friends and family who have given me a place to stay while I study and practice,<br>
and to all my friends who I haven't yet stayed with but always promise that I can whenever I need/want to: <br>
I owe you everything. <3 <br>
