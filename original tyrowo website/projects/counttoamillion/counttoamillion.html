    <p class='smolText' style='padding-left: 2em'>
        Back when I was a kid I had this strange fascination with counting. <br>
        I had a goal - to write out every number from 1 to a Million. <br>
        Why? I'm not sure. I think I wanted to set a world record or something.
        Ultimately, I gave up at about 1,000 or so. If that. <br>
        Now that I'm learning to code, I've been trying to learn how to write numbers in hexadecimal,
        but it's been giving me a little more trouble than binary. <br>
        I realized that with a little bit of code I could practice learning my numbers the same way I
        did when I was a kid- writing them out one at a time. <br>
        and Technically since it's in my handwriting, I'll have finally accomplished my childhood goal! <br>
        It'll take a couple days to finish, but feel free to watch lmao.
    </p>

    about me -
    Inspirations
      I'd like to thank my mother and father, my sister and brothers, my friends and my family,
      for always encouraging me to be myself, no matter how weird I've gotten over the years.
      I'd thank my grandma polly for teaching me checkers, and my darlin for teaching me poker.
      My dad first got me a gameboy with Kirby's Adventure In Dreamland, 
      and Super Smash Bros went on to be a huge part of my childhood, so huge thanks to Masahiro Sakurai.
      Although I had to take a break for about 12 years, I love Magic the Gathering and think Richard Garfield is a genius.
      Although role playing hadn't ever been a big part of my childhood, huge shoutouts to Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson for creating DnD
