    My handwriting is the text for this page, because I want you to see my work how I see my work.
    in a way, this website is about me, for me. I organize it like I organize my notebooks at home (pictures)

    about me -
    Inspirations
      I'd like to thank my mother and father, my sister and brothers, my friends and my family,
      for always encouraging me to be myself, no matter how weird I've gotten over the years.
      I'd thank my grandma polly for teaching me checkers, and my darlin for teaching me poker.
      My dad first got me a gameboy with Kirby's Adventure In Dreamland, 
      and Super Smash Bros went on to be a huge part of my childhood, so huge thanks to Masahiro Sakurai.
      Although I had to take a break for about 12 years, I love Magic the Gathering and think Richard Garfield is a genius.
      Although role playing hadn't ever been a big part of my childhood, huge shoutouts to Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson for creating DnD
      Portal
      Pokemon - Satoshi Tajiri
      Undertale - Toby Fox
      The Last of Us - Bruce Straley and Neil Druckmann
