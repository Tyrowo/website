            <p>
                <br>
                Hi, my name is Tyler Crews (he/him), and welcome to my website! <br>

                Tyrowo is a moniker I've adopted. A sort of portmanteau, where Tyro means
                "a beginner, or novice," and OwO is an internet-ism - it's a text-based emoticon expressing piqued
                interest or curiosity in something. <br>
                Together, they express my overarching goal in everything I do: Enjoy whatever you work at as if it
                were
                brand new to you, and as if there is always much to learn. <br>
                No matter how good you find yourself at something, if it's worthwhile to you then
                it's
                worth getting better at it. <br>

            </p>

            <h2> From Scratch </h2>
            <p> Everything you see on these pages are products solely of my own effort and creativity. <br>
                I (hopefully not too obviously) refrain from using any website-creation assistance from products like
                WordPress,
                because I'm committed to learning how to do everything myself, with the full range of customizability
                and freedom of expression that the internet has to offer. <br>
                I crafted not only the html and code here, but even the font to create a truly personalized experience
                and expression of self. <br>
                I was able to use the web app
                <a href='https://www.calligraphr.com/en/'>Calligraphr</a>
                to adapt my actual handwriting into this typeface. In addition to using it for this site, I actually use
                it in my word processors and code editors on my personal computer. <br>
                So what you're seeing here is what I write, how I write it. <br>
                I hope it's legible enough for you! ‚úö

            <h2> Self Taught</h2>
            <p>
                I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2015 with a bachelor's degree
                in biology and a minor in English. <br>
                Although I actually didn't attend any computer science classes there, I made many lifelong friends in
                the
                computer
                science department through my involvement in UNC Chapel Hill Esports. <br>
                After working for half a decade as a Sleep Technologist, one of my best friends from school encouraged
                me to take up coding as a hobby. <br>
                So to learn fundamentals I started with free online courses at <a
                    href='https://www.codecademy.com/'>Codecademy</a>. <br>
                Then I learned basic methods and furthered my comprehension by working problems on <a
                    href='https://www.codewars.com/'>CodeWars</a>, and used <a href='https://cssbattle.dev/'>CSS
                    Battle</a> to get a feel for basic CSS properties.
                <br>
                A few months ago I moved on to practice problems on <a href='https://leetcode.com/'> Leet Code</a>,
                where I work to improve my understanding of algorithms in Javascript, and practice writing SQL queries.
                <br>
                <!-- I don't want to add this line until I make resources but eventually make a resources page
                
                Of course the greatest resources of all are <a href='https://google.com/'> Google</a> and <a
                    href='https://youtube.com'> Youtube</a>, but I'm compiling a more comprehensive list of the coding
                resources that I use. I'll be putting it
                <a href='https://www.tyrowo.com/resources'> here, but for now I haven't written it out yet.</a> <br>
                -->
                <!-- stackoverflow, w3schools, youtube channels-->
                I'd also like to sincerely thank all of my friends who have taken the time to help me
                with problems and answer my questions along the way.

            <p> I'm constantly inspired by independent artists, especially game developers. <br>
                A few I admire in particular:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Richard Garfield, Magic: the Gathering
                <li> Toby Fox, Undertale and Deltarune
                <li> Matt Stone & Trey Parker, South Park
                <li> Satoshi Tajiri, Pok√©mon
                <li> Pendleton Ward, Adventure Time
                <li> Masahiro Sakurai, Kirby and Super Smash Bros.
                <li> Bo Burnham, Inside

                <li> Hayao Miyazaki, Studio Ghibli
            </ul>
            <p> I hope any of my future creations are nearly as influential as any of these peoples' works. ‚ù•

    in a way, this website is about me, for me. I organize it like I organize my notebooks at home (pictures)

    about me -

    pictures of my notebook (to accompany my handwriting), animal crossing garden, need to think of more lol

    Inspirations
      I'd like to thank my mother and father, my sister and brothers, my friends and my family,
      for always encouraging me to be myself, no matter how weird I've gotten over the years.
      I'd thank my grandma polly for teaching me checkers, and my darlin for teaching me poker.
      My dad first got me a gameboy with Kirby's Adventure In Dreamland, 
      and Super Smash Bros went on to be a huge part of my childhood, so huge thanks to Masahiro Sakurai.
      Although I had to take a break for about 12 years, I love Magic the Gathering and think Richard Garfield is a genius.
      Although role playing hadn't ever been a big part of my childhood, huge shoutouts to Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson for creating DnD
